# Project Overview: News Recommendation Challenge on MIND Dataset

Welcome to my repository for the major assignment in the Recommender Systems course, semester 2022.1. This project is centered around a compelling competition on news recommendation, hosted by Microsoft, and utilizing the MIND dataset. You can find detailed information about the competition [here](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/420).

In this repository:
* ðŸ“œ Paper Summaries: I have meticulously summarized various academic papers that provide insights into the models and dataset pertinent to news recommendation.
* ðŸ“Š Evaluation Metrics: A compilation of various evaluation metrics used in the competition is provided, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of how the models are assessed.
